""" Useful routines for calculating properties of optical materials

Many of the routines defined in this package are focused on calculating the
optical properties of common nonlinear optical materials.

The module defines a number of useful routines for calculating properties
of optical materials.  It contains:
  - Fresnel equations for calculating the reflectivity of an uncoated optical
    surface based on its index of refraction
  - Sellmeier equations for calculating the index of refraction as a function
    of wavelength for some common materials
  - A routine for calculating the principle indices of refraction in an
    arbitrary direction through a uniaxial or biaxial optical crystal
  - A group of routines to calculate the walk-off angle between the k-vector
    and the Poynting vector in uniaxial and biaxial optical crystals.

def mat_sellmeier_lbo(wvlnt, temp):
    """ Gives the principal indices of refraction for LBO with temp dependence

    The Sellmeier equation is an empirical relationship for the indices of
    refraction of optical materials versus wavelength.  The coefficients of
    the Sellmeier equation are generally found by fitting empirical data
    measured with e.g. a spectrometer.  Note that the wavelength in the
    equation is the vacuum wavelength and not the wavelendth in the material
    itself.  For materials with differing indices of refraction along the
    different axes, the Sellmeier coefficients are measured for each axis
    independently.

    The Sellmeier coefficients for LBO are taken from data on the Castech
    website which is valid at room temperature.  There is also data, which is
    commented out currently, from [1] below.  The temperature dependence is
    taken from [2] below.  The range of validity for the temperature
    dependence if from 20-200 C.

    Calcium Fluoride is an isotropic crystal so, like fused silica, it has the
    same index of refraction for all 3 crystal axes.  However, to be
    consistent with the other sellmeier functions in this module, this
    function returns three values for the index of refraction. The equations
    for both the index of refraction and dn/dT are taken from [1].

    The base temperature for for the index of refraction is 20 C, and dn/dT is
    also from data taken at this temperature.  This measured dn/dT is
    simply multiplied by the temperature difference from the base temperature
    and summed with the index of refraction at the base temperature.  So,
    temperatures far from the base temperature have increasing amounts of error
    because the temperature dependence of dn/dT is not taken into account.

    Note that a small amount of birefringence is often observed in calcium
    fluoride due to internal stress from thermal gradients during growth of
    the crystal.  This can cause design problems in highly polarization
    dependent optical systems, but is not accounted for by this function.

    This function calculates the walk-off angle of interest in type 2 second
    harmonic generation.  This is the walk-off angle between the average index
    of refraction for the fundamental and the lower index of refraction for the
    second harmonic.    The calculation relies on `walkoff_fromprop` and is taken
    from [1].
