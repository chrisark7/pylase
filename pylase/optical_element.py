""" Creates a class structure for optical elements

The key difference between an optical element and a ray matrix is that an
optical element can consist of several ray matrices which together act
as a single element.  The most common example is that of a thick lens which
consists of two curved interfaces and an intervening translation.

The optical element class contains a position and label for the optical element
as well as a list of the ray matrices which make up that element and a list of
their positions relative to the element's overall position.
